# Haply Experiments

This repository contains experimental projects and prototypes using the **Haply haptic device**. The goal is to explore novel interaction techniques, feedback mechanisms, and integration with virtual environments. The experiments are iterative, showcasing progress over time, feature additions, and hardware-software interfacing efforts.

## ðŸ§ª Description

**Haply Experiments** is a collection of tests and experiments aimed at:
- Exploring haptic feedback for immersive experiences.
- Building interaction scenarios using the Haply API.
- Prototyping haptic-based interfaces for VR/AR, robotics, and new applications.

These experiments serve both as research groundwork and as technical benchmarks.

## ðŸ”§ Requirements
- Haply SDK v2.2.0
- Unity 6.0
